                        and James Caviezel, a chiropractor. He has a younger brother, Timothy, and three sisters,
                        Ann, Amy and Erin. He was raised in a tightly knit Catholic family in Conway, Washington. His

                    <p class="sub-text">Caviezel began acting in plays in Seattle. He earned his Screen Actors Guild
                        card
                        with a minor role in the 1991 film My Own Private Idaho. He then moved to Los Angeles to pursue
                        a
                        career in acting. When he decided to move, "people thought I was out of my mind," he said.[9] He
                        was
                        offered a scholarship to study acting at New York's Juilliard School in 1993, but he turned it
                        down
                        to portray Warren Earp in the 1994 film Wyatt Earp. He later appeared in episodes of Murder, She
                        Wrote and The Wonder Years. After appearing in G.I. Jane (1997), he had a breakthrough
                        performance
                        in the 1998 Terrence Malick-directed World War II film The Thin Red Line. He played Black John,
                        a
                        Missouri bushwhacker, in Ride with the Devil (1999), an American Civil War film.

                        Caviezel was originally cast to play Scott Summers / Cyclops in X-Men (2000), but dropped out
                        because of a scheduling conflict with the film Frequency (2000). He starred in the mainstream
                        films
                        Pay It Forward (2000), The Count of Monte Cristo (2002), and Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius
